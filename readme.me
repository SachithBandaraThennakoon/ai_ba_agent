🔥 Step 1 — Delete the Vector Store Folder

Close your app first.

Then delete this folder:

vector_db_store/


(Just delete it manually from File Explorer)

This removes all old embeddings.

🔁 Step 2 — Re-ingest Documents

Open a Python shell in project root:

python


Then run:

from vector_db.company_knowledge import load_company_docs
load_company_docs("company_docs")


You should see:

✅ Company knowledge loaded into Vector DB


Exit Python:

exit()

▶ Step 3 — Run App Again
python app.py
